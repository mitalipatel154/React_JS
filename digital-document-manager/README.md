# ⚙️ How It Works

* 1️⃣ The user selects a file or drags it into the upload area.
* 2️⃣ The file is converted into **Base64 format** using `FileReader`.
* 3️⃣ The Base64 file data is stored in **Firebase Realtime Database 🔥**.
* 4️⃣ The app listens for **real-time database updates 🔄**.
* 5️⃣ Files are displayed as **cards with preview, rename, delete, and download options 📂**.

# 💻 Installation

## 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-document-manager.git
```

---

## 2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder

```
cd digital-document-manager
```

---

## 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

---

## 4️⃣ Run the development server

```
npm run dev
```

The application will start on:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

# 🔥 Firebase Setup

* 1️⃣ Open **Firebase Console**
* 2️⃣ Create a new project
* 3️⃣ Enable **Realtime Database**
* 4️⃣ Set database rules for development

Example rules:

```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```

5️⃣ Copy your Firebase configuration into:

```
src/firebase/firebaseConfig.js
```

# 📤 File Upload Method

Instead of using Firebase Storage, this project stores files as **Base64 strings inside Firebase Realtime Database**.

Example stored file data:

```
{
  "name": "document.pdf",
  "type": "application/pdf",
  "data": "data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJc...",
  "date": "2026-03-13"
}
```

This allows the app to **preview files instantly in the browser 👀** without needing storage permissions.
