## 🧩 Component Description

### 🔹 App.jsx
- Main component of the application
- Manages records using state
- Handles add, edit, delete, and clear operations
- Syncs data with `localStorage`

---

### 🔹 RecordForm.jsx
- Handles adding and editing records
- Uses controlled form inputs
- Performs basic validation
- Switches between **Add Mode** and **Edit Mode**

---

### 🔹 RecordList.jsx
- Displays records in a table
- Shows **“No Records Found”** when empty
- Passes record data to `RecordRow`

---

### 🔹 RecordRow.jsx
- Displays a single record
- Contains **Edit** and **Delete** buttons
- Demonstrates passing arguments to event handlers

---

## 🎯 React Concepts Used

- Functional Components
- `useState` Hook
- `useEffect` Hook
- Controlled Forms
- Event Handling (`onChange`, `onSubmit`, `onClick`)
- Props and argument passing
- Conditional Rendering
- Browser `localStorage`

---

## 💾 Local Storage Workflow

- Records are loaded from `localStorage` on app load
- Any add, edit, or delete updates `localStorage`
- Data persists even after refreshing the page
